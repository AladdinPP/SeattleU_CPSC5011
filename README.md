The title of this course is Object-Oriented Concepts. I took this course in 23 Winter Quarter.  
In this course, we learned the principles of design by contract as well as inheritance and composition using C++ and C#.  
The four project assignments were designed to switch between these two languages and each one was built on the previous one.
